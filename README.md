# My Cooking Library

<h2>  What is it?</h2>
<p>As an avid collector of cookbooks, both vintage and current, I created an app that would allow me to organize my cookbooks by bookshelf (i.e. location).</p>

<p>Each bookshelf has a name that indicates the current state of the cookbook it stores:

  - Vintage
  - Active (currently using)
  - Planning (using for menu planning)
  - Reading (reading and perusing)
  - Inactive (sitting on the shelf)

<p>Additionally, each bookshelf has a general location so if I am looking for a particular book and can't remember where I last left it i can look up the location.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<p> I used Rails, HTML, and CSS with a bit of JS.  Thanks to the folks at w3schools.com I was able to gussy up my app using and adapting [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp).
<p>W3.CSS allowed me to add the accordion "bookshelves", the cookbook "cards", and create the overall design of the app including the menu bar.
<p>The W3.CSS stylesheet is included in app>assets>stylesheets.  Previous and updated versions can be found here: [W3.CSS versions](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_downloads.asp)
